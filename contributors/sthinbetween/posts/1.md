Which is great, because this means: the randomness in the system kind of works, right? 

So, what is *this*?
To be honest, I really don't know yet. What I know, is that I really enjoyed the talk, that brought me here:

If you haven't already, please take some time and watch it, before you continue reading: 

["Why we need to reinvent media - and how" on media.ccc.de](https://media.ccc.de/v/rc3-197227-why_we_need_to_reinvent_media_and_how)

After we share the same knowledge about this talk know, I want to give you some context: 
It's December 28, 2020 and it's day two of the RC3, my first ever chaos-experience. Me, a 30-year old autistic being, is overwhelmed by all the new input. But yet, it is not the usal "everything-sucks"-overwhelmedness. No. I am overwhelmed by the experience, that an event like the RC3 can even exist. All these people coming together to share, care for each other and organize an non-profit-event of this size? I am baffled. 

Then I saw this talk. And it instantly resonated with me. For a long time now, I have been thinking about how we all - as a society - can function 'better' in long sight. Which tasks need to be fullfilled to achieve the 'good life for all'?

The way, in which we process all the information available to us, seems to be vital. Only if we understand, what the source of our information is, we can really use it to form an opinion. 

The direction [butterfy.me](https://www.butterfy.me) is taking, seems to be a great step in the right direction. What it needs is us, creating content in old and news ways, and being excellent to each other. 

Don't let the gesamtscheisze kill our utopian thoughts.

So for now, *this* **is**: 

- a "thanks for this great talk" to Vardon Hamdiu
- a work in progress
- an opinion 
- a first step on a possibly bigger project
